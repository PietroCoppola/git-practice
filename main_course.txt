The main course of the meal will consist of:
Authentic Spaghetti alla Carbonara with Guanciale, Parmigiano Reggiano, and Pecorino Romano. Traditional Roman-style carbonara, made with perfectly al dente spaghetti, savory guanciale, and a 
creamy sauce crafted from Parmigiano Reggiano and Pecorino Romano. Each bite combines rich, smoky flavors with a luxurious, velvety texture, all brought together with a hint of cracked black pepper.
